Project Kelp is developed with retail SMEs in mind. The aim of this project is to be an introduction application to complex business information systems for traditional small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). 

 

Traditional SMEs commonly facing cost difficulties when transitioning towards modern information systems especially in the training cost of the employees. This project provides a solution by offering a web-based application for an inventory management system with easy-to-use graphical user interface which has a low learning curve and low hardware requirement. 

 

The application includes simple GUI and self-explaining icons to avoid confusion to the user. 

 

The project contains possibility of expanding into a complete Enterprise Resource Planning system (ERP) in the future, along with some useful small features like file sharing and timetable tools. 

 

The website will first ask visitor to login or register their account, then the user will be redirected to the website's main page, allowing them to use various functions of the inventory management system including create their own stock list, register new product, and make changes to current inventory records.
